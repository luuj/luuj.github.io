## Novel Bayesian Model for Nursing Home Data
<img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/nursing.png"> Nursing homes were hit hard during the COVID19 pandemic, and many news outlets reported rising interest in the quality of care of these nursing homes. I am developing more efficient models to analyze cost and healthcare utilization data from nursing homes. Furthermore, I am creating new joint metrics that can be used to better compare the quality of nursing homes.

This project is the center of my current dissertation with Sebastien Haneuse. We are looking into a Bayesian model that can tackle the statistical challenges of clustered semi-continuous data. We are also incorporating the competing risk of death into our models, due to the high mortality rate in nursing homes. To see my current progress, check out my <a href="https://github.com/luuj/Semi-continuous-Bayesian-Modeling">simulation and model code</a> on GitHub.

## COVID19 Duration of Viral Shedding Study
<img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/covid.png"> Isolation and distancing practices are fundamental elements of COVID-19 epidemic control. However, the CDC currently recommends only 5 days of quarantine after a positive test. We were interested in whether this recommendation should be re-extended.

For this study, we collected longitudinal viral load, viral culture samples, and CT values from Massachusetts General Hospital employees who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. For our analysis, we adjusted for covariates including variants of the virus (original, delta, omicron) and vaccine status. We determined that the previous CDC recommendation of 10 days was needed.

## Phase I RCTs and the 3+3 Design
<img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/ct.png"> Before a drug can be introduced to market, it needs to undergo extensive testing. The first stage of this testing procedure is the phase I clinical trial, where drugs are tested for toxicity and the correct dosage. Currently, the most common design for phase I clinical trials is the 3+3.

Supervised by Susan Groshen of USC Norris Cancer Center, I wanted to compare the 3+3 to more modern methods at evaluating dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose. We found that despite the lack of statistical theory backing the 3+3, it performed very well when compared to the continual reassessment method, several Bayesian methods, and the rolling 6.

## Pokemon Battle Simulator
<img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/pokemon.png"> 
Pokemon is a popular franchise where players set out to capture and battle creatures they encounter. I, along with 4 other friends, created this simulator which attempts to recreate the battling component of the Pokemon video games. 

We implemented animated sprites, attributes from the player-run <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Wiki">wiki</a>, and the various battle formulas present in a typical Pokemon battle. Players are able to choose teams of 6 from the original 151 generation I Pokemon. Battle either locally or over WiFi with chat and emojis. Check out our implementation <a href="https://github.com/luuj/Battle-Simulator">here</a>.

## Destructo-Block Mobile Game
<img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/destructo.png"> 
Neopets was a popular website that allowed users to raise a cartoon pet, explore an interactive point-and-click world, and play hundreds of flash games to earn neopoints. One addicting game from Neopets was Destruct-o-match, a puzzle game with a goal of destroying as many blocks as possible by clicking on bundles of adjacently colored blocks. 

To learn the workflow of developing an Android mobile game, I recreated this flash game using assets from the original. I coded up the algorithm that enforces the game's rules, set up a point scoring system based on how many blocks were destroyed, and included a timer that limits how much time players had to complete each level. Levels were randomly generated and made to get increasingly harder. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/luuj/Destructo-Block">game here</a>.

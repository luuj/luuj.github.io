# Courses I've Taught

During my time at Harvard, I have been a teaching assistant for three courses:

-	Applied Survival Analysis (BST223) - 2 years
-	Intro to Data Science (BST260) - 1 year
-   Survival Methods in Clinical Research (BST224) - 1 year

Being a teaching assistant comprises of teaching labs and the occasional lecture, maintaining the course website, holding weekly office hours to answer questions, grading homeworks, attending weekly meetings with the professor, and creating course material (labs, homeworks, exams, in-class quizzes, and solutions).

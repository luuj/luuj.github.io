<p><img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/nursing.png" /> Nursing homes were hit hard during the COVID19 pandemic, and many news outlets reported rising interest in the quality of care of these nursing homes.

Furthermore, I am creating new joint metrics that can be used to better compare the quality of nursing homes.</p>

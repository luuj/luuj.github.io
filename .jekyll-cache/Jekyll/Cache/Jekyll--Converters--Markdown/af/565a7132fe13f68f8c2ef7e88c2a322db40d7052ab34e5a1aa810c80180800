<p><img align="left" width="300" style="padding-right:10px;" src="/assets/images/nursing.png" /> Nursing homes were hit hard during the COVID19 pandemic, and many news outlets reported rising interest in the quality of care of these nursing homes. I am developing more efficient models to analyze cost and healthcare utilization data from nursing homes. Furthermore, I am creating new joint metrics that can be used to better compare the quality of nursing homes.</p>

This project is the center of my current dissertation with Sebastien Haneuse. We are looking into a Bayesian model that can tackle the statistical challenges of clustered semi-continuous data. We are also incorporating the competing risk of death into our models, due to the high mortality rate in nursing homes. To see my current progress, check out my <a href="https://github.com/luuj/Semi-continuous-Bayesian-Modeling">simulation and model code</a> on GitHub.</p>
